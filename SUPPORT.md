# Support

If you need help adopting bun-ready in your org, CI integration, or want extra checks (monorepo graph, workspace-level scoring, custom policies), we can help.

## Community support (free)
- GitHub Issues: use bug/feature templates
- Discussions (if enabled): best-effort answers

## Paid support (best-effort)
We keep it simple:

### Tier 1 — $20
- Best-effort async help via GitHub Issues (prioritized)
- Guidance on interpreting reports + suggested fixes

### Tier 2 — $100
- Best-effort deep dive (within reason)
- Help designing a migration plan/checklist for your repo
- Review of your report output and recommended actions
